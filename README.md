# 2dPortalGame

Wanted to add alot more things to the game but could not because I was in the hospital for 2 days (eid day and the day before eid) because of a heatstroke.

Here is how you play the game:

Move around using W A D (W to jump and A D to move left and right respectively)

The fairy that follows you shoots the portals (Not you)

The direction of the portal is decided by the mouse direction and the fairy

Shoot both portals before teleporting (Right click for entry portal and left click for exit port but it really doesnt matter since both are bi directional)

You can remove the portals by pressing R

Kill the enemies by pressing space
